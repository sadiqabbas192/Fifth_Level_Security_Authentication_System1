# Fifth Level Security Authentication System

A comprehensive Java-based authentication system implementing five robust layers of security for highly sensitive applications.

## Overview

**Fifth Level Security Authentication System** is designed to provide multi-layered protection for user authentication. This system combines several security mechanisms, making it suitable for applications where data privacy and access control are critical.

## Features

- **Five Layers of Authentication:** Sequential security steps such as password, OTP, biometric, security questions, and more.
- **Java Implementation:** Pure Java codebase for maximum portability.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend or replace authentication steps as per requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with attention to usability.
- **Open Source:** Freely available for modification and integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or command-line tools

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadiqabbas192/Fifth_Level_Security_Authentication_System1.git
   cd Fifth_Level_Security_Authentication_System1
   ```

2. **Import into your IDE** (or open the directory if using command line).

### Build & Run

- **Using an IDE:**
  - Import the project.
  - Locate the `main` class (commonly named `Main.java` or similar).
  - Run the main method.

- **Using Command Line:**
  ```bash
  javac -d bin src/*.java
  java -cp bin Main
  ```
  *(Replace `Main` with the actual main class name if different.)*

## Usage

1. On running the application, users will be prompted to proceed through five distinct authentication stages.
2. Each stage must be completed successfully to gain access.
3. The system can be customized to change, add, or remove authentication levels as needed.

### Example Authentication Flow

1. **Password Entry:** Standard username and password validation.
2. **OTP Verification:** One-Time Password sent to email or phone.
3. **Security Questions:** User must answer predefined questions.
4. **Biometric Simulation:** (If implemented) Simulated biometric check.
5. **CAPTCHA:** Basic human verification.

## Customization

- To add a new authentication level, implement the required logic in the Java source and sequence it in the authentication flow.
- For real-world deployment, integrate actual biometric and OTP providers.

## Supported Java Versions

- Java 8 and above
